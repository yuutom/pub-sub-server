# For Phase 2
Note that at this time this application is a single server. (1~3 ms/request)</br>
Therefore, in order to meet the Phase 2 requirements, it is necessary to control the workload and manage transactions appropriately, for example by load balancing with a load balancer in the first stage.

Also note that this application is volatile because it uses an in-memory DB for data retention.</br>
To prevent message loss, consider making the DB non-volatile and redundant.
